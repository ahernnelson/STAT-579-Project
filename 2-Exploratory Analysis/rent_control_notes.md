### Notes
1. Discrepancy between public data for hosuing distribution of rental units with rent control or stabilization and sample estimates. Are there sampling issues to address here?

2. Key Takeaway: Rent Regulated units are, on average, in worse condition than owner occupied or unregulated units.

3. Most rent regulated units were built before 1947, there may be confouding issues here. Should address. Rent controlled units are rare and almost certainly have confounding factors that increas PQI (tenants must have occupied since 1971)

4. Public housing stock indicates a clear quality issue. Mitchel Lama housing appears to be the best option.

5. Investigate the other regulated units further and what type of people live in them.

6. Conduct formal tests for inference
